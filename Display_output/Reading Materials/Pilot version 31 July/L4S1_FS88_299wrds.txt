What is the toughest creature on Earth? Some people would say cockroaches. There is a myth that they could survive a nuclear winter. The truth is, they couldn't. There is one creature that could, though. It can live in places where nothing else can. What is it? It's called a Water Bear. It's also known as a "tardigrade." This comes from the Latin. It means "slow walker." Water Bears were first discovered in 1773. They are very small. They thrive in the most extreme environments on the planet. They live in both the equatorial and polar regions. You can find them in swamps, deserts, glaciers, and hot springs. One of their most amazing feats is "cryobiosis." They can stop their bodily functions while losing up to 97%-99% of their moisture. When they find water again, they come back to life. They can easily stay 10-20 years in this state. The current known record is 120 years. When the Water Bears dry up, they become "tuns." These are small capsules. They are easily moved by the wind, the oceans, or even through an animal's gut. This allows them to spread across the planet. And then there's the radiation. Water Bears can hold up under 500,000 rads. Humans die at about 1,000-2,000 rads. We suffer a great deal of damage with much less. In 2007, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the FOTON-M3 capsule. It was full of science experiments. One of these was a large number of Water Bears. They orbited the Earth for 12 days, exposed to near vacuum. They also got healthy doses of solar and cosmic radiation. How did they hold up? About 68% came back just fine, as if they had never left the planet.
