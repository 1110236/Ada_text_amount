An African elephant's skin is an amazing organ. In fact, it is very thin despite the animal's large size. Across most of the body, an elephant's skin is only about 2-4 cm thick. That's about 0.78-1.6 inches. This thin membrane has to hold together an 8,000-13,000-pound animal. That weight puts a lot of pressure on the skin. Some places need extra support. One area is around the belly. The belly has an extra band of skin to hold in all the organs. Elephants need to cool off. They don't have any sweat glands, like humans do. They've come up with other ways. Around the ear, the elephant's skin can be as thin as 1 mm. Blood moves in the veins in the ear. Because the skin is so thin, it can transfer heat better to the air outside. The elephant's wrinkles also help it cool off. First, they create more surface area. Second, the wrinkles capture water when the animal bathes. They hold the water longer, too. This lets the elephant evaporate the heat over a longer time. Humans have hair to keep us warm. An elephant has hair to keep it cool. We have about 2 million hairs per square meter. The elephant's hair is sparse. It has only about 1,500 hairs total over the same area. This helps the elephant move heat away from its body. The hair is not thick enough to hold the heat in.
