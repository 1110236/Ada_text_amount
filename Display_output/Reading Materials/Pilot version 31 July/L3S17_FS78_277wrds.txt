Beatrix Potter is one of the most famous children's authors and illustrators. Her first book was "The Tale of Peter Rabbit," and she wrote over 20 more after that. Potter was born as Helen Beatrix in London in 1866. Her brother, Walter Bertram, was six years younger. Their parents were rich, and they lived in a large house which meant they were raised by a governess (Miss Hammond) who also taught them at home. They had many animals in the classroom, including rabbits, beetles, hedgehogs, and mice. When Potter was about six, she started drawing plants and animals, taking art lessons from a special teacher. Potter had always drawn pictures of her pets, and when she was 24, she tried to sell some of them. A greeting card company bought some, then asked for more, so she began thinking of illustrating for a living. She was still in touch with Annie, one of her previous governesses, whose oldest boy was named Noel. When he turned five, she wrote him a letter in words and pictures. It told the story about her pet rabbit, Peter. Seven year later, Potter thought about making the story into a book. Noel still had her letter, which she copied, and she drew new pictures to go with it. She sent it to six publishers, but no one wanted it. She decided to print it herself. A friend showed the story to Frederick Warne and Company. They said they would publish it if Potter did the drawings in color. In 1902, "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" came out and was a great success. Potter wrote and drew until her death in 1943.
