Kids love Play-Doh. So do some adults. The squishy putty is loads of fun to play with. But, do you know how it got its start? In the 1920s, Kutol was a Cincinnati-based soap company. It was doing badly. Cleo McVicker's job was to sell off the company's assets. Cleo, though, managed to turn a nice profit. The company was able to stay afloat. Cleo hired his brother, Noah. The two set about trying to build the company back up again. In 1933, Cleo met with Kroger grocery store representatives. They asked him if he made wallpaper cleaner. This was an important product since, at the time, most people heated their homes with coal. It left a layer of soot everywhere. It was also difficult to clean. Cleo told them he did, although no one at Kutol knew how to do it. Kroger then ordered 15,000 cases of the cleaner. Fortunately, Noah figured out how to make it using a version of a then-common formula. This gave the brothers steady sales for about a decade. After World War II, though, sales began to drop. Oil and gas furnaces replaced coal. These didn't produce a sooty by-product. Sales dropped even more when vinyl wallpaper became available. It could be cleaned with nothing but soap and water. The McVickers' product was now obsolete. Kay Zufall was a relative of the McVickers. In 1954, she was running a nursery school. She needed cheap materials to make Christmas decorations. She saw in a magazine that wallpaper cleaner was good to use. Knowing the trouble the company was in, she went out and bought a bunch of Kutol's wallpaper cleaner.  The kids had a blast. She told her family they should make the cleaner into a toy. They removed the detergent from the dough and added some coloring to the white paste. Play-Doh was born. They had no money to market it. However, they got Captain Kangaroo to use it on his show. Sales of Play-Doh jumped.
