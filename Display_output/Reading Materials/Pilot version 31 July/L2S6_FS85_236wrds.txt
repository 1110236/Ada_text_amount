Have you ever seen green potato chips? Have you heard that they're poisonous? What's the real story? Potatoes are roots. That means they grow underground. The leaves of the plants get sunlight, but not the roots. Sometimes, though, part of the roots come above ground. These parts turn green as chlorophyll develops. Chlorophyll is what plants use to produce energy. It's also what makes them green. Sometimes a green-colored potato may get all the way to a potato chip factory. That means there might be some green chips in the bag. It's not very likely, though. Modern technology has ways to weed out the "bad" chips. Chlorophyll itself is non-toxic. However, when the potato goes green, it may make more of a poison called solanine. Potato plants produce it in their leaves, stems, and sprouts. They may also make it in the root if it's above ground. It helps them fight off predators, like insects. Solanine isn't just bad for insects. If a person eats a large amount, they can get very sick. Some symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, and paralysis. It can even cause death in extreme cases. But you shouldn't worry. You would have to eat about 10-20 green potatoes in a day to get sick. A medium-sized potato makes about 36 chips. So, if you find one or two green chips in a bag, it wouldn't do you much harm.
