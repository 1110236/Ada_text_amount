A "speleothem" is a structure in a solution cave. It is usually made of calcite. It forms from water dripping through the cave. There are many different types. A "drapery" is a delicate example. Draperies are thin sheets of calcite. They hang from the cave's ceiling. They may grow over three meters long, and they may be so thin you can see through them. Draperies form when a calcite-rich drop of water flows along a sloping ceiling. It leaves a light trail of calcite behind it. One drop follows another until the trail builds up. As water moves through the soil above the limestone cave, it can pick up minerals. These may color the water. When the water soaks down through the ground and drips into the cave, it forms a colored trail. Since the drapery takes a long time to form, the minerals in the soil can change. This leads to different colors and colorful stripes. Sometimes the dripwater can flow down a cave's walls or floor. When it does, it forms thin sheets of calcite. These are known as "flowstone." The ripples in the structures give the impression that the rock flows through the cave. Pools of water and slowly flowing streams can cover the floors of the limestone caves. Some may have rims of calcite deposits. These are called "rimstone dams." They often form in steps along a floor that slopes downward. Each dam holds a pool of water. The water flows from one pool to the next one lower down. The water shakes as it jumps down, depositing some calcite. This forms the dam. Some dams may be a few millimeters high. Others can build up to 90 centimeters or more.
