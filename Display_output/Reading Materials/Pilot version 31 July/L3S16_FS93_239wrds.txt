Belugas and other whales live in the ocean. They are not fish though. They are mammals, like us. They are warm-blooded and nurse their young. They also breathe air. To breathe, the whales use a blowhole. It is a nostril found on top of their heads. When a whale dives in the water, it takes a breath. Then a flap covers the blowhole. This keeps water out. When the whale comes back up, it opens the hole again. It also blows out its held breath. It can hold its breath for almost 20 minutes. We know that belugas talk. They also use sound to find food when they can't see. They make clicking sounds. These move through an organ on the forehead. It is called a "melon." The organ focuses the clicks into a beam of sound. This bounces off of objects and comes back as an echo. The echo can tell the whales how far away an object is. It can also tell them how big it is and its shape. This process is called "echolocation." This is what bats use to find food, too. Belugas have great hearing. The ears are small openings located behind the eyes. However, they actually hear most sounds through their jawbones. The lower bone is hollow and filled with fat. Sound waves pass through it and move to the inner ear bones. They send the signals to the brain.
