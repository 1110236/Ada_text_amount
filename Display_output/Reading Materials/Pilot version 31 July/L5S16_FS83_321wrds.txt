Jesse Owens went to Ohio State University. He was on the track-and-field team. His coach was Larry Snyder. Owens dominated his events. In May 1935, Owens had a meet in Michigan. He ran the 100-yard dash; he not only won it, but he also tied the world record. Then he did the long jump. He broke the old world record by over six inches. He next broke records in the 220-yard dash and the low hurdles. What Owens wanted, though, was to go to the Olympics. At the tryouts, he won all his events. The 1936 Olympics were being held in Berlin, Germany. Adolph Hitler had become Germany's leader in 1933. He believed White Christian people were better than Jews and Blacks. He was sure they would win, but Owens wanted to prove him wrong. The first event was the 100-meter dash. It was cold and raining, but Owens saw only the track. He crossed the finish line almost 10 feet ahead of the others, winning a gold medal and tying the world record. He was proud when the American flag was raised for him. The next day was the long jump event, and each jumper got three tries to make it to the finals. Owens' first two tries were not allowed because he had stepped past the starting line. Suddenly, he felt a hand rest on his shoulder. He looked up to see Lutz Long, one of the German long jumpers. He was Owens' biggest rival, but he said for him not to worry. He gave Owens advice on how to make the last try count, and he was successful. In the finals, Owens ended up winning the gold medal, and he also won gold in the 200-meter dash and the 400-meter relay, setting four Olympic records. Hitler was angry, but the German crowds loved him, and he also became an American hero.
