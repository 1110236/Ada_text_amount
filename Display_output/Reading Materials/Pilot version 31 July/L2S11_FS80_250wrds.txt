Mercury has always been mysterious. It is a small planet, though larger than now-dwarf planet Pluto. It orbits very close to the Sun, so it's always in its glare when we look at it. In addition, it never appears high in Earth's sky. Sometimes it can be seen just after sunset or just before sunrise, but is always close to the horizon, making it difficult to spot. Until recently, all the information we had about Mercury came from the Mariner 10 probe. Mariner 10 was launched on November 3, 1973. It got a gravity assist at Venus before heading to Mercury. It arrived in March 1974. The probe discovered a world similar to Earth's moon. It used to have active volcanoes. It now has mountains a mile high. It also has large craters. They were made by meteors crashing into the surface. It also told us that Mercury is the fastest planet. It moves at 128,000 mph. It is the densest planet, too. Its materials are tightly packed together. It has a solid core. The core is about 70% iron. This is more than any other planet. That's because when it formed, the surface rock melted. The iron sank to the center of the planet. Mercury has the smallest orbit since it's the closest planet to the Sun. The part of the surface that faces the Sun is hot enough to melt lead. The part that doesn't is so cold (-173 Celsius) that it has sheets of ice.
