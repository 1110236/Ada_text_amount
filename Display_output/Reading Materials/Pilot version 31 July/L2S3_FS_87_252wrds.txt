Claude Monet was a painter. He did not look at a scene before painting. He quickly put down what he thought it should look like. His work started a new era in painting. Monet was born in France in 1840. His family moved to Le Havre. It was on the north coast. His father, aunt, and uncle worked in the grocery business. Monet didn't like school. When he became a teenager, his teachers saw he had a talent. He could draw well. Claude Boudin was also an artist. He started to teach Monet about painting. When Monet was 18, he moved to Paris to learn more about painting. A year later, he had to go into the army. He was sent to Algeria. He liked the bright, clear light there. He wanted to capture that light in his work. When he got back to Paris, he joined an artists' studio. He made many friends, but he was still poor. He did not sell many paintings. In 1870, Monet married and had a son, Jean. The Franco-Prussian war began. The family moved to London. That way Monet would not have to join the army again. A year later, he returned home. Then, he started to sell his work. Monet and his friends held a show in 1874. A writer at the show did not like the work. He said the paintings looked unfinished. Monet said they were "impressions" of actual things. The artists who used this style called themselves the "Impressionists."
