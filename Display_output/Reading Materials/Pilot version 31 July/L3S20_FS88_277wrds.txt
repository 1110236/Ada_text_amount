People in the Middle Ages often used lead. They could easily roll it out or cast it in molds. They used it to make the roofs of churches which protected the buildings. It ensured they lasted a long time. As early as the 7th century, roofs in England and France were made of lead. Before, they used thatch, but it caught fire easily. Lead did not. Lead crystal is very heavy glass used for bowls and vases. It was invented by George Ravenscroft in 1675. He found that if he added lead oxide to melted glass it made the glass brighter. This is a safe form of lead. We use it today. In the Middle Ages, lead materials were used in homes. Pewter is a blend of tin and other metals, including lead. It was made into plates and mugs. It was used in pottery glazes. Potters mixed it with small amounts of other metals. This gave pewter a range of bright colors. Printing came to Germany in the mid-15th century. A lead and tin mixture made the letters used in the presses. It was mixed so it was easily melted and formed the letters. It was also hard enough that it could be used in the press. When guns were created, people made the bullets out of lead. These were called "shot." The metal's high density made for a powerful impact. A new process for making bullets was created in 1650. The molten metal was poured through a sieve. It dropped into a pool of water below. The metal formed round drops as it fell. The drops became solid when they hit the water.
