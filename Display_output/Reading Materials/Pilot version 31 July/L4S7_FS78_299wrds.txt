Police dogs are special dogs. They help the police in many different ways. They are generally part of K-9 units. The dogs are paired with a human partner. Together they work in many areas of law enforcement. Some of the specific roles police dogs play are: (1) Tracking - The dogs use their powerful sense of smell to track criminals or people who are missing. The dogs are given something with the person's scent on it. It can be some clothing. It can be something they handled. Then, the dogs follow the scent trail to the person. (2) Substance Detectors - Dogs can also use their sense of smell to recognize a specific substance. Sometimes it is illegal drugs. They can sniff luggage or a car to see if it smells right. That saves the officer from having to search every piece of luggage or an entire car by hand. Other dogs can detect bombs or explosives. The dogs are trained not just to find the explosive but also how to safely let their human partner know where the explosive is located. This lets the bomb squad defuse the bomb before it goes off. (3) Public Enforcement - These police dogs help officers maintain order. They can chase a suspect and hold him until the officer arrives. They may also guard an area (like a jail or prison) to keep suspects from escaping. (4) Cadaver Dogs - These police dogs learn how to find dead bodies. This can often help solve a missing persons case or a murder investigation. The breed of dog used depends on the type of work they will do. Bloodhounds are good for tracking. Beagles are good for drug detecting. German Shepherds and Belgian Malinois are popular. All police dogs are trained from puppies to learn their jobs.
