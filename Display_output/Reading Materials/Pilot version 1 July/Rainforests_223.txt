Rainforests are forests characterized by biodiversity and high rainfall, with annual rainfall between 250 and 450 centimeters (98 and 177 in). There are two types of rainforest: tropical rainforest and temperate rainforest. Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator in areas such as South America, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Temperate rainforests, however, are only found in few temperate regions around the world such as Europe, North America and East Asia. Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests. It has been estimated that there may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests. Tropical rainforests have been called the "jewels of the Earth" and the "world's largest pharmacy", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there. Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover; that is why tropical forests are also called "Earth's lungs." Rainforests produce many items that we all use in our daily lives. Tropical rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Other common rainforests products include: chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, rubber, medicine, and pineapples. Rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services provided.
