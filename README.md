The is the code repo for my reserach topic: adaptive text display's prototype.
Still in the progress.
To be continued.

The MODE_RSVP is a testing mode for further research, after the experiment factors are determined. After revision on 28 June, the RSVP mode now is the experimental group for pilot studies. The texts' number of words is presented according to readers' reading duration adaptively.

The MODE_MANUAL is the mode for find out is there a truly relationship between people's reading texts' number and reading time. In the meantime I want to find some other potential influencing factors.

The MODE_PRESENT_ALL is the mode that will present all texts once. This is the control group for pilot studies.

And I now (28 June 2022), we have two modes for running the prototype: The first one is prototype, all variables are open, experimenters could alter them freely to seek potential research questions. The second mode is the demo mode. Only determined variables/parameters that are filtered from the prototype mode is opened to experimenters. And I use configurations to populate parameters.
