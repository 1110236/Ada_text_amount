The is the code repo for my reserach topic: adaptive text display's prototype.
Still in the progress.
To be continued.

The MODE_RSVP is a testing mode for further research, after the experiment factors are determined.

The MODE_MANUAL is the mode for find out is there a truly relationship between people's reading texts' number and reading time. In the meantime I want to find some other potential influencing factors.
